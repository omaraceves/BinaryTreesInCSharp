# BinaryTreesInCSharp
Binary trees implementation in C#. 
Trasversals: In Order, Top down, Bottom up, Tree Level

Problems:
-Max depth, Is symmetric, Has path to sum, Unival subtrees count, Serialize, Deserialize, LCA, etc.

This is a project where I practice Binary trees algorithms found in leet code. I'll be adding a reference to each problem eventually.
